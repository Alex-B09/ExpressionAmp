ExpressionAmp
=============

Expression template with c++ AMP

The goal of this project is to implement some basic linear algebra using expressing template and C++ AMP.

There is no goal on performance. It is just a learning project.

----------------------------

####Current status :
The add operation is almost complete. The only thing left is to handle literals.

----------------------------
####What is working :

Add matrices
Add matrices to (single) variable

----------------------------
####Future features:

  element-wize multiplication
  
  dot product (inner and outer product)
  
  many other...

----------------------------
####Dream Feature (what I'm aiming for in the long run ):

  computing graph optimization : Perform optimization based on the graph computed from the expression.
